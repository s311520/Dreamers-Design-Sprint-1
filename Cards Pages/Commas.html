<h2> Commas </h2>
  <p> Being able to identify independent and dependent clauses will help you to decide where to put commas (or other punctuation) in your writing. </p>
  <p> An independent clause contains a subject and a verb. </p>
    <ul><li> For example: The tree was losing its leaves. </ul></li>
  <p> So it is a complete sentence in itself. However, a dependent clause cannot stand on its own. If it is written alone, it doesn't make sense. It is an incomplete sentence. This is because it is usually missing a subject, or a verb or both. </p>
    <ul><li> For example: Because of the drought. </ul></li>
  <p> We join dependent and independent clauses together to ensure: </p>
    <ul><li> The meaning is clear: The tree was losing its leaves because of the drought. </ul></li>
    <ul><li> The sentence is complete: Because of the drought, the tree was losing its leaves. </ul></li>
  <br>
  <p> Commas are needed to clarify meaning when dependent and independent clauses are added to each other to form complex sentences </p>
  <p> The general rules with commas in complex sentences are: </p>
    <ul><li> If the dependent clause comes after the independent clause (highlighted), no comma is necessary. <br> Village councils play the main role in resolving disputes and meting out justice. </ul></li>
    <ul><li> If the dependent clause is before the independent clause, you need a comma. Outside of the major cities, village councils play the main role in resolving disputes and meting out justice. </ul></li>
    <ul><li> If the dependent clause is in the middle of an independent clause or in the middle of two independent clauses, you need a comma each side of it. <br> The whole parliament, aside from the President, agreed with the proposed legislation. Zahraâ€™s family, who had lived in a small village all their lives, suddenly decided to move to the city. Tehran, with a population of more than twenty million, is a busy, chaotic city </ul></li>
